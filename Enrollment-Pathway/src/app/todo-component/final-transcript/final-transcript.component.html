  <p class="lead">You must satisfy all of the Conditions of Enrollment within the time frames indicated. All enrolling students must satisfy the following conditions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students who are completing their coursework at the end of the spring 2019 semester at their current school are responsible for submitting a final official transcript of all completed coursework by July 1, 2019 (or within two weeks if your admission occurs after June 10, 2019). We will check your file to verify that all of your transcripts are official and include certification of any diplomas you indicated on your application, as well as final grades for courses in progress at the time of your admission.</li>
    <li>Our audit of your final transcript takes time and our system may not immediately reflect receipt of your final transcript. Please track the status of your final official transcripts on the Your Rutgers Status screen.</li>
    <li>Enrollment in Rutgers University is contingent upon satisfactory completion, with no significant decline in grades, of all academic work still in progress when your application was reviewed.</li>
